# Talk2API
This project demonstrates the execution of APIs using queries typed in natural language

## What we did?
In this project we are going to Talk to the [ReqRes](https://reqres.in/) APIs using plain english language. Also, convert the responses back into human readiable english language

## Why we did?
This project is done to explore the possibility of applying latest AI progress in NLP in creating domain driven, goal oriented chat bots with a flexibility of even going out of domain if required.
